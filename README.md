# Uni Project - Circle
Programming project - Circle

There was a specific circle with an arrow written on it. 

The task was to calculate the coordinates of the arrow's tip, given the center of the circle, the radius, and the angle of the arrow.

The same goes for coordinates of the points at the end of arrow's wings.

## The Main Functionality
Using the equation describing a circle with center A and radius r, and the equations of the lines, determine the points D, E, F describing an arrow directed towards point B and inclined at an angle alpha.
- User provides the input data.
- The program perform necessary mathematical operations, logging all results and operations in the cmd.
- Calculates coordinates of Points D,E,F and outputs them in cmd.
- The arrow's wings size is 10% of the radius.

| Input          | Ouput          |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Point A (x, y) | Point D (x, y) |
| Point B (x, y) | Point E (x, y) |
| Radius (r)     | Point F (x, y) |
| Angle (alpha)  |                |

## The main folder
Due to the fact that I am currently focusing on learning Python, I will rewrite the initial script to that language.
