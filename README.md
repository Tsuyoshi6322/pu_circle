# Circle-P
Programming project - Circle <br />
Used for Uni purposes.

### The main functionality
Using the equation describing a circle with center A and radius r, and the equations of the lines, determine the points D, E, F describing an arrow directed towards point B and inclined at an angle alpha.
- User provides the input data.
- The program perform necessary mathematical operations, logging all results and operations in the cmd.
- Calculates coordinates of Points D,E,F and outputs them in cmd.

| Input          | Ouput          |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Point A (x, y) | Point D (x, y) |
| Point B (x, y) | Point E (x, y) |
| Radius (r)     | Point F (x, y) |
| Angle (alpha)  |                |

The PDF file contains all mathematical operations (in Polish).
